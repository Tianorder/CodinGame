# Telephone Numbers

## ⚽The Goal
* **By joining the iDroid smartphone development team, you have been given the responsibility of developing the contact manager. Obviously, what you were not told is that there are strong technical constraints for iDroid**: the system doesn’t have much memory and the processor is as fast as a Cyrix from the 90s...
In the specifications, there are two points in particular that catch your attention:

1. Intelligent Assistance for entering numbers
The numbers corresponding to the first digits entered will be displayed to the user almost instantly.

2. Number storage optimization
First digits which are common to the numbers should not be duplicated in the memory.

Fortunately, the specifications also have this little chart to guide you in the implementation:
