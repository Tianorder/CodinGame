## Goal
Initially output equals 0. Iterate through each number in the input and perform the following operation:
* **If the number is odd**: Multiply it to output

### Input
* **Line 1**: An integer count which represents the amount of given numbers.

### Output
* **Line 1**: An integer output
0 < count <= 100
-10000 <= number <= 10000
-2147483648 < output < 2147483648
