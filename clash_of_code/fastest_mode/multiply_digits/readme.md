## Goal
Multiply all of the digits of N, and repeat the same with the product obtained till the product consists of only one digit. Output the number of steps taken to do so.

* **Example**: N = 39
* **Step 1**: 3 * 9 = 27
* **Step 3**: 1 * 4 = 4
Since it took us 3 steps to reach a number with only 1 digit, the output is 3.

### Input
* **Line 1 **: An integer N
The multiplicative persistence of N, as described in the example above

### Constraints
* 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^8

### Example

    Input

        39

    Output

        3
