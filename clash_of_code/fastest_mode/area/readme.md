## Goal
A program that calculates the total area of a set of geometric shapes, whose type and dimensions are provided. The geometric shapes can be circles or rectangles. The program should return the total area of all the geometric shapes.

### Input
* **Line 1**: An integer N representing the number of geometric shapes to calculate.

### Output
A single line containing the total area of all the geometric shapes. The total must be rounded to 2 decimal places

### Constraints
* 1 <= N <= 5
* 1 <= a <= 15
* 0 <= b <= 15

### Example

    Input

        4
        R 3 4
        C 2 0
        R 5 6
        C 3 0

    Output

        82.84
